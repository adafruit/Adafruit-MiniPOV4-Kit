Learn as you go, starting with the easier parts and working your way up to the more challenging ones. Takes about an hour or two to complete following our detailed tutorial, depending on your previous soldering experience. 

* Firmware: The Arduino-IDE compatible firmware that draws images from EEPROM

* Hardware: PCB files in Eagle CAD format

* Images: some test pix we use

* Bootloader: The V-USB based bootloader that lets you program the EEPROM over USB for uploading new images.
